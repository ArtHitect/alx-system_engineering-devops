### Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:**
- **Start Time:** June 12, 2024, 14:30 UTC
- **End Time:** June 12, 2024, 17:15 UTC

**Impact:**
- **Affected Service:** User authentication service was down.
- **User Experience:** Users were unable to log into their accounts or experienced significant delays.
- **Affected Users:** Approximately 70% of the user base.

**Root Cause:**
- A misconfiguration in the load balancer settings that caused an overload on a critical authentication server.

### Timeline

- **14:30 UTC:** Issue detected by a monitoring alert indicating a spike in authentication failures.
- **14:35 UTC:** Initial investigation by the on-call engineer, focusing on recent code changes.
- **15:00 UTC:** Assumption that the issue might be due to a recent deployment, rollback initiated.
- **15:30 UTC:** Rollback completed, but the issue persisted. Escalated to the infrastructure team.
- **15:45 UTC:** Infrastructure team began examining network and server logs.
- **16:00 UTC:** Misleading investigation path - assumed it was a DDoS attack due to high traffic.
- **16:30 UTC:** Identified misconfiguration in load balancer settings.
- **16:45 UTC:** Adjusted load balancer configuration.
- **17:00 UTC:** Monitoring confirmed the resolution of the issue.
- **17:15 UTC:** Full service restored.

### Root Cause and Resolution

**Detailed Cause:**
The load balancer was misconfigured during a routine maintenance update, causing it to route all authentication requests to a single server rather than distributing them evenly. This server became overloaded, leading to slow responses and timeouts.

**Detailed Resolution:**
Upon identifying the misconfiguration, the load balancer settings were corrected to ensure proper distribution of requests. The configuration change was tested and verified in a staging environment before being applied to production. This resolved the overload issue and restored normal service operation.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements and Fixes:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Audit:** Regularly audit load balancer configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement detailed monitoring and alerts for load distribution and server load.
3. **Deployment Protocols:** Strengthen deployment protocols to include checks for critical configuration settings.

**Task List:**
- **Audit Load Balancer:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of current load balancer settings and rectify any inconsistencies.
- **Add Load Monitoring:** Integrate monitoring tools to track load distribution in real-time and set up alerts for anomalies.
- **Update Deployment Checklist:** Include verification steps for load balancer configurations in the deployment checklist.
- **Training Session:** Conduct a training session for the infrastructure team on the importance of configuration management and best practices.
- **Documentation:** Update documentation to include detailed steps for verifying load balancer settings post-maintenance.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and ensure more robust handling of our authentication services.
